Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies through a single API. With Bedrock Agents, you can build intelligent applications that can reason through complex tasks and interact with external data sources. Through Auth0 and Okta integration, organizations can enable secure user authentication, fine-grained authorization, and centralized identity management for generative AI applications.

The workshop aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively combine Auth0, Okta, and Amazon Bedrock, enabling organizations to build secure, enterprise-ready AI applications while maintaining strict control over data access and user permissions through fine-grained authorization policies.
