This workshop will show you how to integrate Amazon Bedrock with Auth0 + Okta to build secure generative AI applications. You'll learn best practices for user authentication, fine-grained authorization, and controlling access to external data sources when creating enterprise AI solutions with Amazon Bedrock Agents.

In today's workshop, we will build a secure GenAI application that uses Amazon Bedrock Agents for AI capabilities and Auth0 for user authentication. You'll learn how to implement secure token storage and control which external data sources users can access based on their permissions.

This workshop is designed for developers, cloud architects, and security professionals building secure AI applications. You should have basic Amazon Bedrock experience, understand OAuth/OIDC authentication, and be comfortable with REST APIs, Python, and JSON configuration files.

### Today's Workshop Overview
1. **Lab 1**: Set up Auth0 instance and configure Okta as identity provider
2. **Lab 2**: Create and configure your GenAI application 
3. **Lab 3**: Implement Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) and integrate Amazon Bedrock
4. **Lab 4**: Test role-based scenarios and AI agent responses
5. **Lab 5**: Explore more capabilities (Optional Lab)

### Estimated Time and Cost
1. This workshop will take about 90-120 minutes to complete, depending on which modules you explore.
2. The estimated cost is less than $5-10 (Amazon Bedrock model usage + Lambda execution + S3 storage).
